| O | Nav area paint | When a Nav World 2D exists | Click = assign selected area; Alt-click = clear area. |

## Selection, history and playback shortcuts

These global shortcuts are ignored while you type in a text field, while the Script Editor is open, and while the Export window is open. Ctrl is Cmd on macOS.

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Delete / Backspace | Delete the selected entities | Requires a selection. |
| Ctrl+C | Copy selection | Yields to normal text copy when text is selected on the page. |
| Ctrl+V | Paste |  |
| Ctrl+D | Duplicate selection | Copy + paste in one step. |
| Ctrl+Z | Undo | Scene edits and Animation-editor edits keep separate histories; undo acts on whichever editor is active. Up to 100 steps. |
| Ctrl+Shift+Z or Ctrl+Y | Redo |  |
| Space | Toggle Play | Opens or closes the Play window. |

## Conditional controls

Some controls intentionally do not exist until the related scene object exists. This is important when documenting or generating instructions: do not tell users to click a hidden tool before creating the required object.

| Control | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| Tile (T) | A Tilemap or Tileset exists in the current world. |
| Erase (Y) | A Tilemap or a Nav World 2D exists (a Tileset alone does not enable it). |
| Path (P) | A Stroke Path exists. |
| U / I / O Nav brushes | A Nav World 2D exists. |
| Nav bounds/cells view | A Nav World 2D exists. |
| Paint Area selector | Nav Area tool O is active and named areas exist. |
