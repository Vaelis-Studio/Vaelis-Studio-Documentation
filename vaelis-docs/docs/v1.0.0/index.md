# Vaelis documentation

> Complete, source-verified documentation for Vaelis 1.0.0: editor workflows, scripting API, components, physics, navigation and export.

- Source: docs/v1.0.0/index.html
- Engine version: Vaelis 1.0.0

> **What is Vaelis?:** A browser-based 2D game engine with a Unity-style visual editor, an entity–component runtime built on PixiJS (rendering) and Rapier2D (physics), and a JavaScript scripting API. The editor, runtime and exporter ship as a static site — no build server is needed to make or play games.

### [Build your first game](getting-started/first-game.html)

Entities, components and a first script in a few steps.

### [Scripting quickstart](getting-started/scripting.html)

onStart, onUpdate, `this` and the component modules.

### [Editor controls](editor/controls.html)

Exact menu paths, panels and keyboard shortcuts.
